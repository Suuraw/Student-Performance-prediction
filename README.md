# Student Performance Prediction

This project predicts student performance using a **Jupyter Notebook** and evaluates model accuracy with the **R² score** metric.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to analyze various factors that affect student performance and develop a predictive model. This model will help in understanding the key determinants of student outcomes and potentially support educational improvements.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various features that are presumed to influence student performance, such as:
- **Study hours**
- **Attendance rate**
- **Parental education**
- **Socioeconomic status**

> **Note:** Ensure that the dataset is available and preprocessed appropriately before running the notebook.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handles missing data and prepares features for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Insights and visualizations to understand relationships.
- **Modeling:** Uses regression techniques to predict student performance.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluates model accuracy using the R² score.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-performance-prediction.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd student-performance-prediction
```
3. Install the Required Lib
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
#### Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook StudentsPerformance.ipynb
Run each cell in the notebook to preprocess data, build models, and evaluate the results.
## Results
The model's accuracy is measured using the R² score, which indicates how well the predicted values approximate the actual data points. The results and findings from the predictions are visualized in the notebook, helping to analyze the model’s performance.
